# NewsScope

NewsScope is a news search, summarization, and sentiment analysis app built with Python and Streamlit. It uses the GNews API to fetch news articles based on user input, and then applies TextBlob for sentiment analysis. It also employs AI21's Summarization API to generate a brief summary of the article. The app has two pages, one for searching news articles and one for displaying top headlines. The user can specify the language, country, and maximum number of results for the search. The app displays the title, summary, sentiment, and URL for each article found. 

The following libraries are required for this project:
- streamlit
- pandas
- textblob
- requests
- urllib

You can install these libraries using pip, for example: 

```python
pip install streamlit
pip install pandas
pip install textblob
pip install requests
pip install urllib
```
